## Developer Skills Activity

This repository contains a new responsive promo module, shown at two different sizes. Fork the repo and create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the module as illustrated in the [Module Image](https://github.com/rocket-media/dev-skills-activity/blob/master/widget.jpg). We should be able to clone the repo and run the page locally to interact with the module.

See how far you can take it in 2 to 3 hours. Please target modern(ish) browsers (FF/Chrome/Safari/IE9+), but the module will need to function in IE8. Include graceful degredation and/or fallbacks when necessary.

Please code the page and organize the assets as you would if handing off to a co-worker to integrate (not necessarily to deploy).

Don't overthink it. This is just a conversation starter.
